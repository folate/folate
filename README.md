## About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Jakub, a university student majoring in Information Technology.

### Skills
- 💻 **Languages & Technologies:** Proficient in C# and the .NET ecosystem (Xamarin, Avalonia, ASP.NET, MAUI).

### Current Projects
- 🌟 **Currently working on:** A mobile app that scrapes the eDziekanat website. The official mobile API lacks many important features and has subpar UI/UX. My app aims to expand and improve the features and user experience compared to the official app, providing a more comprehensive and user-friendly solution for students.

### Interests
- 🌐 **Development:** Passionate about web development and mobile development.
- 🎶 **Hobbies:** In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, playing computer games, indulging in photography, and taking late night walks.

### Motivation
- 🚀 **What drives me:** The ability to create anything I can imagine. I love the freedom and creativity that coding provides, allowing me to turn ideas into reality.

### Goals
- 🎯 **Primary goal:** To ensure that the projects I work on, like the eDziekanat app, are useful in everyday life and make a positive impact on users.

Feel free to check out my repositories and see what I’m working on. Let’s connect and collaborate!
